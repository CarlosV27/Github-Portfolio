## Hierarchical data structure

### Instructions:

- Open the input file binnacle_Heap.txt
- Sort it by IP (without considering the ports)
- Groups all the records of the file by ip.
- Store them in a Priority Queue, where the value of each node will be a structure with the IP data and the number of accesses of that IP.
- Find the five IPs with the most accesses.
