### Compilation of academic activities where a hypothetical real-life situation is presented and resolved by implementing data structures and algorithms in C++.

#### General Description:

According to the FBI, cyber attacks through bot networks have proliferated to the point of causing great damage in all sectors.
One way to detect this type of situation is through the collection of all the pertinent information that allows us to make optimized searches for the timely detection of malicious access through robot networks.
* What data structures are used to store this type of information?
* What data structure will serve to make the search for information more efficient?
* How to know if an access is malicious?
* How to distinguish "real" access from those that are not?
* How can we make groups of information that characterize these accesses?
