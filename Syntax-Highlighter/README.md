## Syntax Highlighter

In this activity my task was create a python syntax highlighter using the programming language Go because it supports concurrency, I created two functions, one for the sequential method and other for the concurrent method due to that was a requirement for the project but it can easily work just with one. I used a transition matrix to simulate the Deterministic finite automaton functionality.
The prupose was realice that when a large amount of files was given, concurrency helps to reduce the execution time considerly.

**go** run code_file.go input/directory/path output/directory/path
