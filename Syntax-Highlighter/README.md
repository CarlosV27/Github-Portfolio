## Syntax Highlighter

In this activity, my task was to create a python syntax highlighter using the programming language Go because it supports concurrency. I created two functions, one for the sequential method and the other for the concurrent method, because that was a requirement for the project, but it can easily work just with one. I used a transition matrix to simulate the Deterministic finite automaton functionality.
The purpose was to realize that when a large number of files are given, concurrency helps to reduce the execution time considerly.
